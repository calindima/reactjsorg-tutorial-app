## First step towards learning React

Found this tutorial on the official https://reactjs.org/ website, with a complete step by step to go through the fundamental concepts of React.
As a person who understands how things work by picking them apart or building them myself, it was a nice experience.
Besides the step by step, I went on to add a few of the extra features suggested in the end of the tutorial, which I found to be the most useful, because that meant messing stuff up, fixing errors, doing a bit of research and then enjoying the satisfaction of coming up with viable solutions.
